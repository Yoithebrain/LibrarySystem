# LibrarySystem

Case 1 - Week 6 - Level 2

This is a simple library system created by Christian and Jonatan, in it you can borrow books, reserve books and create user. The project includes a class diagram to show how the database is setup and it follows OOP principles with SOLID.

## How to run the program

To run the program you need the following:

- Clone this repository

- A version of Python installed, I used version 3.9.0

- A version of Pip installed, I used version 20.4

- An SQLLite database or make use of the one that's in the project folder already. If you make use of a different SQllite database, make sure to point towards it in the Database.py file

Create a python virtual enviroment in the cloned repository using the following command in Windows PowerShell:

```
Windows: python -m venv venv
```

If you haven't configured a python path run:

```
Windows: C:\Users\Name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python -m venv venv
```

To run the virtual enviroment run:

```
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

install all the required libaries run:

```
Windows: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the program run:

```
python main.py
```
